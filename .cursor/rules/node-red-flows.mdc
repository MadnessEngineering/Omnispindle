# Node-RED Flow Structure Guide

## Overview
This project contains Node-RED flows that implement a Todo management dashboard with MongoDB integration. The flows are stored as JSON files in the `Todomill_projectorium/ExportedNodeRedTabs/` directory.

## Working with the Codebase

### Development Workflow
- **Focus on HTML and JavaScript files**: Make changes only to the HTML (ui_template nodes) or JavaScript (function nodes) files in the `JavascriptFromFunctionNode/` and `HtmlFromTemplateNode/` directories
- **Deployment process**: After code changes, the new code should be deployed through the Node-RED GUI
- **JSON files are for verification**: The exported JSON files are only for verification purposes after changes are deployed
- **Do not edit JSON directly**: Unless specifically asked, avoid editing the JSON flow files directly

## Key Components

### Node Types
- `ui_template`: HTML/JS/CSS components that render the UI dashboard
- `function`: JavaScript functions that process messages
- `mongodb4`: Database operations against MongoDB
- `switch`: Routes messages based on topic or properties
- `link in/out`: Connects different parts of the flow together
- `debug`: Used for flow debugging

### Message Flow Pattern
1. User actions in the UI generate messages with `topic` like `todo/action/X`
2. These are routed through the `Route by Action` switch node
3. Dedicated function nodes prepare database queries
4. The mongodb4 nodes execute the operations
5. Response handlers process the result
6. Results are published back to the dashboard via `link out` nodes

### Dashboard Structure
- Todo List panel: Displays pending todos
- Insights panel: Shows AI-generated suggestions
- Editor panel: For editing todo details

### Data Flow
```
UI Action → Router → Function Processor → MongoDB → Response Handler → Dashboard Update
```

### Key Files
- `JavascriptFromFunctionNode/*.js`: JavaScript code for function nodes
- `HtmlFromTemplateNode/*.html`: HTML templates for UI components
- `todo-dash-masterfile.json`: Main dashboard flow (for reference only)
- `TodoEdit.html`: Template for editing todo items
- `EditActions.js`: Routes edit actions to appropriate handlers

## Special Patterns
- Topics beginning with `todo/action/` trigger server-side operations
- Topics beginning with `todo/dashboard/` send data to UI components
- MongoDB operations use specific formatting based on mongodb4 node requirements

## MongoDB Response Format Handling
- The system is designed to handle both old and new MongoDB response formats
- Old format: `{result: {ok: 1, nModified: 1, n: 1}}`
- New format: `{acknowledged: true, modifiedCount: 1, matchedCount: 1}`
- Response handlers check for both formats to ensure compatibility

When working with this codebase, be aware that paths to resources are relative to the Node-RED instance, not the project structure.
